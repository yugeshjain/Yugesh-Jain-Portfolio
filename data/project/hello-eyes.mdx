As the world’s first virtual vision center, it help people get glasses, contacts, and even new prescriptions, all from the comfort of home. The app includes several cutting-edge tools, including an online vision exam that delivers doctor-issued prescriptions within 24 hours.<br />

The Hello Eyes app puts the power of an optical shop in your hands. You can access lens scanning, pupillary distance (PD) calculations, and vision exam technology in one convenient place. Some of the free features include scanning an existing pair of glasses for prescription details and getting your PD calculation in seconds. Soon, you’ll even be able to acquire a brand new prescription from home. The vision exam technology will generate clinically-accurate data, allowing eye care professionals to determine your new prescription within 24 hours.<br />
